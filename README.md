### About the dataset
The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 374 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. It includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.

### Problem
Sleep is one of the most important factor in leading a healthy lifestyle. We spend about a third of our lives sleeping â€” or at least we should. But unfortunately, many of us fall short of that goal. According to a research, insomnia or "lack of sleep" affects about one-third of the population.


### Solution 
Using the dataset in the notebook, a classifier model is created to predict whether the person has a sleep disorder or not.
